# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game made with Python, Tkinter and Pillow.

# How to use

All the code is in the ```main.py``` file.

There is a .exe file that is used to run the game. Very straightforward and simple :)

# Things Used

I used the built-in library Tkinter for the GUI, and the Pillow library for image resize.
